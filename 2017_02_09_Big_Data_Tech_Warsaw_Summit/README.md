- "H2O Deep Water - Making Deep Learning Accessible to Everyone" by Jo-fai Chow, H2O.ai Data Scientist

    - Deep Water is H2O's integration with multiple open source deep learning libraries such as TensorFlow, MXNet and Caffe. On top of the performance gains from GPU backends, Deep Water naturally inherits all H2O properties in scalability. ease of use and deployment. In this talk, I will go through the motivation and benefits of Deep Water. After that, I will demonstrate how to build and deploy deep learning models with or without programming experience using H2O's R/Python/Flow (Web) interfaces.
