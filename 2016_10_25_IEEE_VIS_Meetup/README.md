Intro to H2O.ai : Spice up VIS with Machine Learning

TUESDAY, OCTOBER 25
12:00PM - 2:00PM
Location: Peale C
Organizer: Ivy Wang and Lauren DiPerna

H2O is an open source, distributed machine learning (ML) platform designed for big data, with the added benefit that itâ€™s easy to use on a laptop (in addition to multi-node cluster capabilities). The core machine learning (ML) algorithms of H2O are implemented in high-performance Java, however, fully-featured APIs are available in R, Python, Scala, REST/JSON, and also through a web UI (Flow). In this meetup, we will introduce how to get started with this easy-to-use open source library. We will explore ways H2O.ai can help with your VIS projects. Join in to discuss the possibilities, benefits of ML and how VIS can better explain and facilitate ML processes.
