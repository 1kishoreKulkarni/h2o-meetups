- Talk #1: 

    - Ensemble machine learning methods are often used when the true prediction function is not easily approximated by a single algorithm. Practitioners may prefer ensemble algorithms when model performance is valued above other factors such as model complexity and training time. The Super Learner algorithm, also called "stacking", learns the optimal combination of the base learner fits.  The latest version of H2O now contains a "Stacked Ensemble" method, which allows the user to stack H2O models into a Super Learner.  The Stacked Ensemble method is the the native H2O version of stacking, previously only available in the h2oEnsemble R package, and now enables stacking from all the H2O APIs: Python, R, Scala, etc.

- Talk #2

    - Deep Water is H2O's integration with multiple open source deep learning libraries such as TensorFlow, MXNet and Caffe. On top of the performance gains from GPU backends, Deep Water naturally inherits all H2O properties in scalability. ease of use and deployment. In this talk, I will go through the motivation and benefits of Deep Water. After that, I will demonstrate how to build and deploy deep learning models with or without programming experience using H2O's R/Python/Flow (Web) interfaces.
